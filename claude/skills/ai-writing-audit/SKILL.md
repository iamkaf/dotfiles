Audit content and source code for AI-generated writing patterns. Rewrite flagged content to sound authentic and developer-like.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when content reads like it was generated by AI:
- Overuse of hype verbs (unleash, elevate, empower, foster, spearhead, unlock, delve, leverage)
- Corporate adjectives (robust, comprehensive, seamless, cutting-edge, meticulous, pivotal, ironclad, turbocharged)
- Formulaic bridge phrases ("in the rapidly evolving landscape of...", "it is important to note that...")
- Perfectly symmetrical lists with emoji + bold + formulaic explanation
- Overly polite/corporate language ("please feel free to...")
- Generic foo/bar examples without domain context

## Scan Targets

**If paths provided:** Scan each specified path (files, directories, or glob patterns)

**If no paths provided:** Scan common locations including:
- README.md, README*
- docs/**, src/**, content/**, lib/**, **/
- All markdown and source files project-wide

**File types:** markdown (.md, .mdx), source code (.js, .ts, .py, .go, .rs, .java, etc.), config files, and text files

## Process

### Phase 1: Scan and Identify

For each file found, flag content matching these patterns:

**Vocabulary Red Flags:**
- Hype verbs: unleash, elevate, empower, foster, spearhead, unlock, delve, leverage
- Corporate adjectives: robust, comprehensive, seamless, cutting-edge, meticulous, pivotal, ironclad, turbocharged
- Bridge phrases: "in the rapidly evolving landscape of...", "it is important to note that...", "here is a breakdown..."

**Structural Tells:**
- Emoji bullet points where every feature has emoji + bold header + formulaic explanation
- Perfectly symmetrical lists where each item is identical length
- Marketing speak for simple tools

**Tone Issues:**
- Overly polite/corporate language ("please feel free to...")
- Unwarranted enthusiasm
- Generic foo/bar examples without domain context

### Phase 2: Report (Always)

Before making changes, present a report with:
- Files scanned
- Specific lines with AI patterns and pattern type
- Suggested rewrites for each flagged section

**Always wait for approval before proceeding to Phase 3.**

### Phase 3: Rewrite (After Approval)

After approval, rewrite flagged content following this style:

**DO:**
- Write like a developer explaining work to another developer
- Use casual shorthand (repo, config, PR)
- Be direct about limitations and tradeoffs
- Allow personality and inconsistency
- Prioritize clarity over polish

**DON'T:**
- Use hype verbs or corporate adjectives
- Create perfectly symmetrical lists
- Add unwarranted enthusiasm
- Be overly polite
- Use generic examples
